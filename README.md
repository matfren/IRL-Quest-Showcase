IRL Quest uses only JavaScript and Expo to create a basic drag and drop game as it currently stands. It seeks to add some gamification to the real world and make daily tasks a little fun. 

As an end user completes real life tasks those tasks will translate to in-game experience. The tasks will translate to the appropriate type of experience, for example exercise will give strength and homework
will translate to intellect.
